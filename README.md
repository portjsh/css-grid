CSS Grid with graceful fallback using grid-polyfill by https://github.com/FremyCompany/css-grid-polyfill

<h2>Why Use this?</h2>
The purpose of this project is to be able to code website layouts in CSS Grid and have them work with javascript until the native browser supports CSS Grid. There is no need for additional coding just add classes to the html elements and you are all set.
<h3>Example</h3>
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, and...
This line is on its own line, because the previous line ends with two
spaces.
